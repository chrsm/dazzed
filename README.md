### [recenter.dsa](recenter.dsa)

**DISCLAIMER: I DID NOT WRITE THIS. I simply formatted it.**
**See header in file for full credits and a link to the forum thread.**

[recenter.dsa](recenter.dsa) recenters the world around the selected object.

This is useful for many scenarios, but the reason I have needed it is due to
Daz bugs when objects are too far from the world origin (black eyes, haircap
poke-through, etc).
